                            v1.1 - 2013.11.25

  Rally is an award winning Agile Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool that helps
  organizations predictably deliver valuable, quality software.  Deliver the
  features users love.  Faster.

  As a vim user, you know what productivity _really_ means.  This plugin
  lets you collaborate with your agile team using Rally and keep your
  fingers on the keyboard.

  This plugin continues to be developed out of necessity and is used by
  the author.  Read some of the interesting |rally-history|.

  See the |rally-maintainer| for contact information.

  /happy coding/

===============================================================================
Installation
                                                           *rally-installation*

  The Rally plugin requires Vim be compiled with support for Ruby.  This may
  require that you compile your own version of vim.  Sounds scary but,
  it can be easy!  I've added notes below for my setup in Ubuntu.  YMMV.

  NOTE: Be sure you already have a Rally account for any edition and can login
        from a browser.
 
  0. Requirements - Verify the list of |rally-requirements|

  1. Verify ruby support in Vim.  If you do not have ruby support, see VIM+RUBY NOTES below.

          $ vim --version | grep ruby      # need to see '+ruby'
          $ vim                            # launch vim
          :ruby puts RUBY_DESCRIPTION      # should show ruby 2.0.0 etc

  2. Install Plugin with Vundle.  If you don't have vundle, see VIM+VUNDLE NOTES below.
          
          *  Add  "Bundle 'davidpthomas/vim4rally'" to your .vimrc vundle section
          $ vim
          :BundleInstall

          Note: During installation, vundle will show you a warning/notice to setup
                your Rally credentials.  Proceed to next step.

  3. Setup - Set file permissions and add your connection/login credentials to
             the Rally properties file.

           * edit ~/.vim/bundle/vim4rally/plugin/rally.properties and add your values
           * Set the permissions on properties file to 600 or 'rw-------' to
             prevent local access.  Vim will warn on startup if permissions are not set.

             $ chmod 600 rally.properties

  4. Documentation - vundle should install the Rally help docs.

             Verify the setup by typing ':help rally' within Vim.

  5. Verify  - Open a file.  Type '\h' to see quickhelp commands.

               When the plugin is loaded, a connection to
               Rally is attempted.  You will see an info notice on the
               success or failure of that connection.  Keep in mind that
               the plugin does a lazy 'full' connection to rally
               (on first real command) since the first interation takes a
               few seconds to cache subscription/workspace details.

  With the plugin installed, see the |rally-tutorial| to get started.
  Check |rally-troubleshooting| if you encounter any installation problems.

  Happy Vimming!

Getting Started Tutorial
                                                               *rally-tutorial*

   Open a file and press '\h'.  See the available commands?  Lets try a
   quick search.
  
   [NOTE: If you get an error, see the |rally-troubleshooting| section below].

   Press '\s'.  Don't know the ID for a story or task?  No problem.  The
   search dialog supports full text searches.  Just enter a word that you
   know is in one of your stories.

   Get some search results?  'j/k' scroll through the list.  Find one you
   want to see the details of?  Just press '\s' again anywhere on the line.

   If the story is an epic, down below you'll see a "fold" containing the 
   children.  Just do 'zo' to open the fold and see the children.  The idea
   is that with folds, we can show children stories, discussion threads,
   revision history, etc. in a small amount of space.  Back on track, scroll
   down and hit '\s' on leaf level story.  That will open.

   On a leaf story, scroll down and look for tasks (if it has some).  Again,
   another fold, so 'zo' to open it up.  press '\s' on a task.

   In a task, you have some options to edit data.  For example, to change
   the 'to do' field, press '\tt' (task todo).  To edit the estimate,
   press '\te' (task estimate).  To toggle the blocked status, press '\tb'.

   Lastly, check out the charts.  To see a burndown chart, press '\cb'
   (chart burndown) or '\cc' (chart cumulative flow).

   Taking a step back, the '\s' lets you search for stories, tasks, and
   defects.  Just press that, enter an ID or a search string.  You can
   review the details and possibly update the tasks.   That's it!

   Take a look at the inline help with '\h'.  Those are all available 
   commands.

   Enjoy!

===============================================================================
Commands
                                                               *rally-commands*


  \h - Rally 'quick' help

      This will show an inline list of key commands with brief description.

  \z - Rally Information

      This will show information about the current connection such as
      workspace, user, etc.  If debugging is enabled in the rally.properties
      file, this will show even more info such as per-window details.

  \w - Rally Workspace [Switcher]

      Prompts the user to select a new workspace.  This workspace will be
      loaded (and cached).

  \s - Search

     One of the most powerful aspects of this plugin is context-aware search.
     No matter where you are, '\s' will react to visual mode selections, current
     line, scan for Ids, and prompt for criteria if no context is found.
     Searching may return a single artifact or multiple, mixed results.
     The algorithm is as follows:

           [visual mode?]                      [normal mode?]
           grab all selected text              grab current line

                           \                     /
                            \                   /
                             \                 /

                                empty results?

                                    |        \
                                    |        [Yes]
                                   [No]         \
                                    |
                                    |           Prompt User for search string
                                    |

                           text contain artifact Id?   (US123, DE456, etc)

                             /                \
                          [Yes]              [No]
                           /                    \

                 Single Artifact Search       General Text Search
                 (display details)            (display multiple results)


  \tt - Task Todo (update)

      This command will prompt to update the ToDo hours for a task. The plugin
      will attempt to find the a task in context from the task details page
      or task ID on current line.  Otherwise, it will prompt for the task ID.

  \te - Task Estimate (update)

      This command will prompt to update the Estimate hours for a task. The plugin
      will attempt to find the a task in context from the task details page
      or task ID on current line.  Otherwise, it will prompt for the task ID.

  \tb - Toggle Task Block (update)

      This command will prompt to toggle the BLOCKED state of a task. The plugin
      will attempt to find the a task in context from the task details page
      or task ID on current line.  Otherwise, it will prompt for the task ID.

  \cb - Iteration Burndown Chart

      This command will show the burndown chart for the currently selected 
      iteration.

  \cc - Iteration Cumulative Flow Diagram

      This command will show the cumulative flow diagram for the currently
      selected iteration.

Troubleshooting
                                                        *rally-troubleshooting*

  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Symptom: Error loading plugin when starting vim.

            Error message may include:
                * no such file to load -- rally_rest_api
                * no such file to load -- builder

   Solution: Install the required gems.
             e.g. $ gem install rally_rest_api --version '= 1.0.3'
             e.g. $ gem install builder --version '= 3.0.0'

  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Symptom: Warning messages about required or not-found property values.
  Solution: Verify that plugin/rally/rally.properties exists.  Inside
            the file, verify that all properties have values set.

              base_url: URL to Rally subscription e.g. http://rally1.rallydev.com
              version: Version of the web service API e.g. 1.25
              username: Your Rally subscription username
              password: Your Rally subscription password
              workspace: Rally workspace to connect to
  
  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Symptom: Warning message about Rally properties file at vim startup.
  Solution: If your plugin/rally/rally.properties file is visible to other users,
            the Rally plugin will show a warning message.  Be sure to set the
            permissions of this file to 600 or 'rw-------'.

            Unix: $ chmod 600 rally.properties
            Windows: Good luck with security.   FIXME

  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Symptom: Rally help documentation not loading.
  Solution: Verify that the rally.txt file is located in the vim /doc
            directory:
            
                     Unix: $HOME/.vim/doc/rally.txt
                  Windows: %HOMEPATH%\vimfiles\doc\rally.txt

            Install help documentation by launching Vim and executing:

                     Unix: :helptags ~/.vim/doc
                  Windows: :helptags ~\vimfiles\doc

            Verify that the help docs are available by launching vim then typing
            ":help rally".

  Most of the plugin development happened while I was traveling; either
  waiting at an airport, 30,000+ feet above sea level, or in a hotel room.
  I also spent spare cycles during evenings/weekends at home in Santa Cruz, CA.
